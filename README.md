# **RABBI //. digital store**

Website mocking an e-commerce created using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

It has a landing page, a Products section and a Wishlist.

The Products page uses Material UI for some of the buttons and high-order function map for the filtering functionality.

The data is stored in a .js file and I used LocalStorage for caching the user's selected products and wishlist items.
